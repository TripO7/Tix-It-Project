Tix It

A Ticketing System where the user can submit any issues they have as tickets. A person with an admin account can then help solve the users problem and can email them to communicate if necessary.

To create a ticket, you need to make an account first and then login. Navigate to the create ticket page and create a ticket describing your issue and wait for an admin to contact you about it to help you resolve it.
